// every variable take some memory in RAM
// garabe collection tell what variables are being used and what aren't an delete which one are not being used

let a = 1;
console.log(a);
let b = 2; // a is no longer in use after we log a same with any other variable so it will delete it after it implement it
console.log(b);
// if all the variables are not it use it will clean up all of them
// in js this is done behind the scene
