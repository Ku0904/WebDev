// everything is inside an Execution Context in javascript
// Execution Context 2 types - 1st( Global Execution Context (GEC) ) and 2nd( Function Execution Context (FEC) )
// In the context of the 'this' keyword, in the Global Execution Context (outside of any function and object), 'this' refers to the global object(window object)
// In Browser it is Global Window Object and in Node it is {} this is an empty object because it refers to exports, and nothing has been added to exports yet //? more on import and export this later

// Execution Context Have 2 phase 1st(Memory Component or Variable Environment) and 2nd(Code Component or Thread of Execution[code is executed one line at a time])
// javascript is a synchronous single threaded language

//! More on this when you study call stack
